## üî¥ TOP 3 CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. HARDCODED QUESTIONS ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå
**Problem:** Questions are hardcoded strings in frontend, NOT AI-generated  
**Impact:** Every candidate gets same scripted questions  
**Location:** `AIInterviewSystemV2.tsx` lines 240-276  
**Fix Time:** 2 days

### 2. WRONG RESPONSES ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå
**Problem:** AIRA says "Excellent!" even when candidate gives wrong answer  
**Example:**  
```
Q: "How would you optimize a database?"
A: "I don't know"
AIRA: "Excellent! One more question..."
```
**This is COMPLETELY WRONG!**  
**Fix Time:** 2 days

### 3. NO TIME MANAGEMENT ‚ùå‚ùå
**Problem:** No duration limits, no time window validation  
**Impact:** Interview can run forever, ignores HR's schedule  
**Fix Time:** 2 days

## üìã ALL ISSUES FOUND

### Critical (Must Fix Immediately)
1. ‚ùå Hardcoded questions (not AI-generated)
2. ‚ùå Wrong response validation (says "Great!" to bad answers)

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING

### Backend (Good Foundation)
- ‚úÖ HR Dashboard fully functional
- ‚úÖ Interview creation system
- ‚úÖ Invitation system with email
- ‚úÖ Time slot selection (3 options)
- ‚úÖ Resume upload
- ‚úÖ Database schema (well-designed)
- ‚úÖ AI service (Gemini) integrated
- ‚úÖ TTS service (Gemini + ElevenLabs)
- ‚úÖ Authentication (Clerk)

### What HR Can Do Now
- ‚úÖ Create interviews
- ‚úÖ Invite candidates
- ‚úÖ Set time slots
- ‚úÖ Add custom questions (but they're not used yet!)
- ‚úÖ View candidate list
- ‚úÖ Track status

---

## ‚ùå WHAT'S BROKEN

### Interview Experience (Needs Major Work)
- ‚ùå Questions are hardcoded (not intelligent)
- ‚ùå No personalization based on resume
- ‚ùå No adaptation to role requirements
- ‚ùå Responses don't match answer quality
- ‚ùå No follow-up questions
- ‚ùå No time limits
- ‚ùå Same coding problem every time
- ‚ùå No conversation memory

### Example of Current vs. Should Be

**CURRENT (Wrong):**
```
AIRA: "Hello John! Can you tell me about yourself?"
John: "I'm a developer"
AIRA: "Great! Tell me about a challenging project"
John: "I don't remember"
AIRA: "Excellent! One more question..."
```

**SHOULD BE (Correct):**
```
AIRA: "Hello John! I see you have 7 years experience with React and led a team at TechCorp. Can you tell me about the microservices architecture you built there?"
John: "I'm a developer"
AIRA: "Could you elaborate on that? I'm particularly interested in your experience with microservices at TechCorp that's mentioned in your resume."
John: "I worked on the backend"
AIRA: "I see. What specific technologies did you use? Your resume mentions React and Node.js."
```

5. Use HR's custom questions

**Outcome:** Interview becomes intelligent, not scripted

---

### Week 2: Add Naturalness (Personalization)
**Goal:** Make interview feel like human conversation

**Tasks:**
1. Generate questions based on resume
2. Align questions with role requirements
3. Add conversation memory
4. Improve pacing and responses

**Outcome:** Interview feels personalized and natural

---

### Week 3: Technical Assessment (Code Execution)
**Goal:** Make coding round actually work

**Tasks:**
1. Create problem database (20-30 problems)
2. Integrate code execution (Piston API)
3. Add syntax checking
4. Randomize problem selection

**Outcome:** Candidates can't cheat, variety in problems

---

### Week 4: Polish & Edge Cases (Robustness)
**Goal:** Handle all edge cases gracefully

**Tasks:**
1. Handle short/long answers
2. Handle no answer (timeout)
