## üéØ Custom Test

You can create your own test by modifying `test-interview.json`:

```json
{
  "candidateName": "Your Name",
  "position": "Your Target Position",
  "experienceLevel": "fresher|mid-level|senior",
  "numberOfQuestions": 5,
  "resumeText": "Your complete resume text here...",
  "roleDescription": "Job description and requirements..."
}
```

Then run:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/test-interview \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @test-interview.json
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Backend is not running"
**Solution:** Start backend first
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### "GEMINI_API_KEY not configured"
**Solution:** Add API key to `.env`
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### "Failed to generate speech"
**Solution:** Check Gemini API key or add ElevenLabs backup
```env
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Questions are generic (not personalized)
**Solution:** Ensure resume has enough detail (skills, experience, projects)
