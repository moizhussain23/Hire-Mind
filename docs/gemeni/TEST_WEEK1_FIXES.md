## üöÄ HOW TO TEST

### Step 1: Start the Application

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ MongoDB connected
‚úÖ Server running on port 5000
‚úÖ Gemini AI initialized
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
VITE v4.5.14 ready
‚ûú Local: http://localhost:3000/
```

---

### Step 2: Test AI Question Generation

1. Open browser: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Navigate to interview test page
3. Fill in:
   - **Name:** John Doe
   - **Position:** Senior React Developer
   - **Skill Category:** Technical
   - **Experience Level:** Senior
4. Click "Start Interview"
5. **Open Browser Console** (F12)

**What to Look For:**
```
ü§ñ Calling backend API for AI-generated question...
‚úÖ Received AI-generated question: Hello John! I see you...
```

**‚úÖ PASS if:**
- Questions are different each time you restart
- Questions mention the position/name you entered
- Console shows API calls
- NO hardcoded "Hello Sarah!" strings

**‚ùå FAIL if:**
- Same question every time
- Generic "Can you tell me about yourself?"
- No console logs
- Errors in console

---

### Step 3: Test Answer Validation

#### Test 3A: Poor Answer
1. Start interview
2. Wait for first question
3. **Give poor answer:** "I don't know"
4. **Expected Response:** "Could you elaborate on that?"

**‚úÖ PASS if:** AIRA asks for more details  
**‚ùå FAIL if:** AIRA says "Excellent!" or "Great!"

---

#### Test 3B: Short Answer
1. Continue interview
2. **Give short answer:** "I'm a developer"
3. **Expected Response:** "Could you give me more details?"

**‚úÖ PASS if:** AIRA asks follow-up question  
**‚ùå FAIL if:** AIRA moves to next question immediately

---

#### Test 3C: Good Answer
1. Continue interview
2. **Give detailed answer:** "I have 7 years experience with React. I built a scalable e-commerce platform that handled 1 million users. I used Redux for state management, implemented code splitting for performance, and led a team of 5 developers."
3. **Expected Response:** "Excellent answer!" or "Great insight!"

**‚úÖ PASS if:** AIRA praises the answer  
**‚ùå FAIL if:** AIRA says "Could you elaborate?"

---

### Step 4: Test Follow-Up Logic

1. Start interview
2. Give short answer: "I used React"
3. **Check console:**
   ```
   üîç Validating answer quality...
   üìä Answer analysis: { qualityScore: 45, needsFollowUp: true }
   üîÑ Asking follow-up question...
   ```
4. Give detailed answer to follow-up
5. **Verify:** Moves to next question (not another follow-up)

**‚úÖ PASS if:**
- Follow-up is asked for short answers
- Question count doesn't increment on follow-up
- Moves to next question after good answer

**‚ùå FAIL if:**
- No follow-up for short answers
- Infinite follow-up loop
- Question count increments on follow-up

## üìä TEST CHECKLIST

### Backend API Tests:

#### Test: Question Generation Endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/ai-interview/question \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "candidateName": "John Doe",
    "position": "Senior Developer",
    "skillCategory": "technical",
    "experienceLevel": "senior",
    "previousAnswers": [],
    "questionNumber": 0,
    "interviewPhase": "behavioral"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "questionText": "Hello John! I see you're applying for Senior Developer...",
    "audioBase64": "base64_string...",
    "audioFormat": "mp3",
    "questionNumber": 0,
    "interviewPhase": "behavioral"
  }
}
```

**‚úÖ PASS if:** Returns question text + audio  
**‚ùå FAIL if:** Error or missing fields

---

#### Test: Answer Validation Endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/ai-interview/validate-answer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "How would you optimize a database?",
    "answer": "I don'\''t know",
    "experienceLevel": "mid"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "qualityScore": 15,
    "isComplete": false,
    "needsFollowUp": true,
    "probingArea": "Can you think of any optimization techniques?",
    "responsePhrase": "That's okay"
  }
}
```

**‚úÖ PASS if:** Returns low score for "I don't know"  
**‚ùå FAIL if:** High score or error

## üêõ COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue 1: "Failed to generate question"
**Cause:** Backend not running or Gemini API key missing  
**Fix:**
```bash
# Check backend is running
curl http://localhost:5000/api/ai-interview/health

# Check .env file
cat backend/.env | grep GEMINI_API_KEY
```

---

### Issue 2: "CORS error"
**Cause:** Frontend proxy not configured  
**Fix:** Check `frontend/vite.config.ts`:
```typescript
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': 'http://localhost:5000'
  }
}
```

---

### Issue 3: Audio doesn't play
**Cause:** Browser autoplay policy  
**Fix:** User must interact with page first (click start button)

---

### Issue 4: Always says "Excellent!"
**Cause:** Validation endpoint not being called  
**Fix:** Check console for validation API call. If missing, check frontend code.
